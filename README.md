This repository provides a robust starter template for building SaaS (Software as a Service) applications, specifically geared towards chatbot services, but easily adaptable for other ideas. It's built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, featuring pre-integrated user authentication (Supabase) and subscription billing (via UpdateDev, which handles Stripe).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally and configured for your own SaaS application.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   A [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) account (for authentication)
*   An [UpdateDev](https://update.dev/) account (for billing - connects to your Stripe account)
*   A [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account (connected via UpdateDev)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url> # Replace with your repo URL if forked
    cd chabot-starter
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server (Initial):**
    *   It's often helpful to start the server now to see initial UI and potential errors:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   The app will likely show errors until configuration is complete. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4.  **Set up UpdateDev & Connect Services:**
    *   Go to [UpdateDev](https://update.dev/) and create an account.
    *   In the UpdateDev dashboard:
        *   Connect your Authentication Provider (Supabase).
        *   Connect your Stripe account.

5.  **Configure Supabase:**
    *   Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.com/).
    *   Set up desired Authentication providers (e.g., Email/Password, Google) under the `Authentication` -> `Providers` section.
    *   Ensure your application URL (`http://localhost:3000` for local dev, `https://your-app.com` for prod) is listed in the Supabase `Authentication` -> `URL Configuration` settings.

6.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy the example environment file if you haven't already:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env.local
        ```
    *   Open `.env.local` and paste in the required keys:
        *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_UPDATE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: From your UpdateDev dashboard.
        *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: From your Supabase project settings.
        *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: From your Supabase project settings.
        *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Set to `http://localhost:3000` for local development, or your production URL.

7.  **Create Billing Products in UpdateDev:**
    *   In the UpdateDev dashboard, go to the **Entitlements** section.
    *   Create an entitlement representing access levels (e.g., `pro`, `premium`).
    *   Go to the **Billing** section.
    *   Create your billing Products (e.g., "Pro Plan Monthly", "Pro Plan Yearly").
    *   For each Product, create Prices (e.g., $10/month).
    *   Crucially, **link each Product to the corresponding Entitlement** you created (e.g., link "Pro Plan Monthly" to the `pro` entitlement).
    *   Once configured, these products/prices should automatically appear on the `/pricing` page in your local application (you might need to restart the dev server).

### Running the Development Server (Final)

If you stopped the server, run it again:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## ‚úÖ SaaS Ready: Billing & Subscriptions

This template is designed to help you launch a paid SaaS product quickly:

*   **Pricing Page:** Fetches products and prices directly from your UpdateDev configuration.
*   **Checkout:** Integrated checkout flow using `UpdateDev.billing.createCheckoutSession`.
*   **Subscription Management:** Users can view their current plan, see renewal dates, cancel, and reactivate subscriptions.
*   **Protected Content:** Easily restrict access to features based on user authentication status (and potentially subscription status in further development).
